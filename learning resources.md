Markdown Journey 
==

I've had a great time going through excercises using the [Commonmark.org](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).
The resource is interactive and has 11 sections to share best practices and mini excercises to allow you to
check for understanding.

My favorite section thus far has been the section on **images**.
Here is my subtle way to celebrate knowing how to display graphics now!

I would highly recommend giving the site a try if you are new to the world of markdown!
